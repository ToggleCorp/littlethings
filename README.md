# Toggle LittleThings - It's the little things!
### Here is a repository filled with incredibly small one-pourpose programs, you can [view all the releases](https://tggl.ml/lt/releases), [download the files in the 'master' branch](https://tggl.ml/lt/all.zip), or contribute. This is entirely open-source, so feel free to have a look inside!
